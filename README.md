# OneLoginCodingChallenge

## Problem Statement

- Write a command-line program in the language of your choice that will take operations on fractions as an input and produce a fractional result. 
- Legal operators shall be *, /, +, - (multiply, divide, add, subtract)
- Operands and operators shall be separated by one or more spaces
- Mixed numbers will be represented by whole_numerator/denominator. e.g. "3_1/4"
- Improper fractions and whole numbers are also allowed as operands 

### Example run:
```
? 1/2 * 3_3/4
= 1_7/8
?2_3/8 + 9/8
= 3_1/2
```
